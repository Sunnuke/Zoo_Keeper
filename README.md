# Zoo_Keeper
This will be a practice on Implementing multiple packages to namespace the project, and inheritance. The concept of this project is to create a program for a Zoo keeper to keep track of animals energy levels. Every mammal should have an energy level, the default 100%, and their energy level will change depending on their activity.
